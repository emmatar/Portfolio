  ## Description

  A webpage to display developing projects and completed work in order to showcase my capabilities to interested parties.

  The mission behind this application was to create an application that would implement React.Js for a better, more efficient developed website. What better to showcase design abilities with React than to do it on my own Portfolio! Cheers!
